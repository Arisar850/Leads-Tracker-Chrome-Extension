# Leads-Tracker-Chrome-Extension
Leads Tracker is a Chrome extension built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to save and manage links and tabs. Users can manually save URLs, save the active tab, and delete all saved links. Data is stored using localStorage for future access. This project demonstrates tab permissions, event handling, DOM manipulation, and persistent storage.
